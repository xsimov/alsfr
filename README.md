# ALSFr

## Why?
Because we love to track our scores through all our boardgames matches.

## Who?
Who what?

### Who develops?
**Anyone!** Feel free to fork and PR, and all the stuff we all know and love.

### Who plays?
ALSFr members, although we are opened to anyone that loves boardgames and is willing to have fun, not only win!

At the moment we keep the app in a local machine, because only a single instance is needed to track the scores of our [Kongresses](http://www.kongregate.com). ;)
